Source Choice:
1 - Pointlike Sr
2 - Extended Sr
3 - ExtY
4 - ExtGa
5 - 511KeV gamma sphere
6 - FlatEle

## GEOMETRY
- Extended Sr Source ending at Z=0
- Cu collimator on top of Sr source (toggleble)
- Pter Detector starting at Z offset (Z distance is from source surface to Front-Shield )
- Front-Shield in contact with Pter (towards source)
- Dummy volume for scoring purposes between source (or if presente CU Collimator) and World to score what exits the primary generation


## FLAGS

- -GaSet is used to choose the experimental setup; if -GaSet1 we are in the case in which we have the probe without the "Catafalco" while in the case -GaSet2 we have the "Catafalco's one". The case -GaSet3 is indeed the configuration in which the "catafalco"'s GaContainer is made by PVC and not by 3D printer such -GaSet2 case.

- -Z is used to choose the distance of the frontshield from the source.

- -AbsT is used to choose the absorber's thickness. If the absorber is not placed in GaSet 2 you have by the way give this value taking in consideration that the distance of the probe's head ( the frontshield ) from the source is given by Z + AbsT/2.

- -AbsD is used to choose the diameter of the absorber's hole in the center of the absorber itself; In -GaSet2 it must be = 0 (not >0 because in this setup the absorber isn't drilled in the midle) if you want to place the absorber and must be < 0 otherwise.                   N.B. in detector construction it is fCuDiam. 

- -ZAbs is used to choose the position of the center of the absorber  respect the source.

- -AbsMat  is used to choose the absorber's material; if AbsMat1->Cu, else if AbsMat2->Pb, else if AbsMat3->Alu, else if AbsMat4->PVC.

- -PosAbs (PosAbsorber) is used to choose absorber width in -GaSet2; if -PosAbs == 1 it will have the same diameter of the hole just near the source, that has 2mm depth, while if -PosAbs == 2 it will have the same diameter of the hole that has 6mm depth, just after the first hole.

- -Source is used to choose the source type: if Source=1 or Source=2 we have respectively point-like or extended Sr source, else if Source=3 we have Y extended source and if Source=4 we have Ga-68 extended source.

- -X is used to change the position of the probe along the x asse. N.B. must be 0 in GaSet2.

- -SourceD is used to choose the diameter of the source; this is preseted to 10mm, the diameter of the Ga container in GaSet2.

- -SourceT is used to choose the thickness of the source; this is preseted to 7mm, the thickness of the Ga container in GaSet2.

- -PterD is used to choose the diameter of the P-Terfenile; this is preseted to 6mm.

- -PterT is used tochoose the thickness of the P-Terfenile; this is preseted to 5mm.

- -CaseLT is used to set the lateral thickness of the probe's case.

- -CaseBT is used to set the back thickness of the probe's case ( the case is a sort of horseshoe and this flag set the thickness of the back part ).

- -HSLT is used to set the lateral thickness of the structure inside the case (this structure looks like an horseshoe too).

- -HBLT is used to set the back thickness of the structure inside the case (this structure looks like an horseshoe too).

- -CaseDepth is used to set the lenght of the probe's case. In GaSet2 if it's >0 the simulation will place inside the case the internal structure while if it's < 0 it'll not.

- -HSMat is used to choose the material of the structure inside the case.                                                                                                    If HSMat1 (default) the inner material inside the inner horseshoe is made of PVC, the horseshoe itself is made of Pb and the externale case is made of PVC.                                                                                                                                                              Else if HSMat2 the inner material inside the inner horseshoe is made of air, the horseshoe itself is made of Pb and the externale case is made of air.                                                                                                                                                                                                              Else if HSMat3 all is made of air

- -AppMat is used to choose the "catafalco's" materials.

2017.12.4 by collamaf
- Added reset of pass counter in stacking action. Seems to increase back of about another 5% the number of exiting particles. now we have about 96% of the beginning. Verified this should be the right approach.

2017.12.12 by collamaf
- Corrected z_resin:  no need to add 1mm of copper since distance is always from source top

2018.01.17 by collamaf
- Deep reorganization of DetConstr, much clearer now
- Code extended to both sensors smoothly (new argument to be passed by terminal, default sensor 1).
- Fixed ExtY source problem

- Introduced possibility to simulate bare SiPm (assumed to be a particular version of Pter detector): SensorChoice=3


2018.05.31 by collamaf
- Now arguments are taken with labels, not necessary to give them all! If a macro is provided no visualization is init.. cool! (removed useless FilterFlag)

2018.06.05 by collamaf
- Added structure to classify energy release due to e-/e+/gamma

2018.06.11 by MorettiR

- Simplification of materials for the probe laparo housing: 3 materials: "Ext" for external housing, "Metal" for metal covering inside and "Inner" for inner part (maybe air)

2018.06.13 by MorettiR
- Probe Casing modified with boolean solids and possibility to choose the presence/absence of the casing, from line comand, simply putting respectively the CaseDepth > 0 or <=0 ( this is true only in the case -GaSet 1 ). 

2018.06.13 by collamaf
- Now when requesting Sphere Source the sphere is centered on the center of the probe case to gain in isotropy
- Changed "entering PTER" condition: now is "from Not PTER to PTER" to consider also tracks from behind (before was "from frontshield")

- Added SiPm volume behind pter to score optical photons entering it
- Added scoring of "Npmt" in root file and "_Scint" to filename
- Now the progress status is printed on screen (since on Primaries file sometimes does not work) and every 10% of evts

- Added flag PosAbsorber to choose absorber position in -GaSet2; if -PosAbs == 1 it will be placed in the hole just near the source, that has 2mm depth, while if -PosAbs == 2 it will be placed  in the hole that has 6mm depth.
- The Absorber thickness could be choosen by AbsT flag while the diameter is fixed in both PosAbsorber cases.
- The flag AbsD must be >=0.


2018.07.17 by MorettiR

2018.07.26 by MorettiR
- New leafs added in B1 and Source Branches 

2018.09.19 by MorettiR
- The position of the Probe in GaSet2 has been modified; now the top of the probe is placed at 5.5mm from the source (before at 8mm).
This because the configuration used at Gemelli's hospital in which the probe was placed on the absrober's surface (We used absorber of 5.5mm thickness). In the configuration without the absorber the probe was placed at the same distance of 5.5mm from the source.
- Fixed the position of the probe, now is take in consideration the dummy2's thickness.
- SourceDiameter now fixed at 10.*mm and SourceThickness at 7.*mm

  N.B. in this way you have always to give AbsT and Z even if you do not want to place the absorber, for more details take a look to the flags section in this ReadMe file. 
- Name of the file with no abs in GaSet 2 has been modified. Now there is inside the name the distance of the probe from the source.


2018.11.14 by MorettiR
- A new leaf called "AnnihilationTime" has been added to B1 vector. This gives you the time elapsed since the positron's creation and his annihilation.
