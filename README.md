## CHANGELOG
2017.12.1 by collamaf
- Try to fix problem of primary particles double counting by putting a check in Stepping Action. Seems to reduce by about ~9% the number of exiting particles (NoCudZ2 test)

2017.12.4 by collamaf
- Added reset of pass counter in stacking action. Seems to increase back of about another 5% the number of exiting particles. now we have about 96% of the beginning. Verified this should be the right approach.

2017.12.12 by collamaf
- Corrected z_resin:  no need to add 1mm of copper since distance is always from source top

2018.01.17 by collamaf
- Deep reorganization of DetConstr, much clearer now
- Code extended to both sensors smoothly (new argument to be passed by terminal, default sensor 1).
- Fixed ExtY source problem

2018.01.30 by collamaf
- Quite deep reorganization of output root file, cleaned a little in ordering and name (and updated readme)
- Changed "ExtY" to "ExtY" in output file naming

- Added double crossing check also for particles entering Pter

2018.04.26 by collamaf
- Added InPterEnPrim to bring primary particle info to Riduzione and DataAnalysis

2018.05.7 by collamaf
- first implementation of storage of time of interection. Still not clear which time to save...
- Introduced possibility to simulate bare SiPm (assumed to be a particular version of Pter detector): SensorChoice=3


2018.05.31 by collamaf
- Now arguments are taken with labels, not necessary to give them all! If a macro is provided no visualization is init.. cool! (removed useless FilterFlag)

2018.06.05 by collamaf
- Added structure to classify energy release due to e-/e+/gamma

2018.06.11 by MorettiR
- Added Probe's Casing in Geometry with parameters from line comand.

2018.06.11 by collamaf

- Added fSourceSelect==5 to generate a sphere (now with R=10cm) around origin of isotropic 511keV gammas to simulate the "far bacgkround" in a Ga68 environment
- Simplification of materials for the probe laparo housing: 3 materials: "Ext" for external housing, "Metal" for metal covering inside and "Inner" for inner part (maybe air)

2018.06.13 by MorettiR
- Probe Casing modified with boolean solids and possibility to choose the presence/absence of the casing, from line comand, simply putting respectively the CaseDepth > 0 or <=0 ( this is true only in the case -GaSet 1 ). 

2018.06.13 by collamaf
- Now when requesting Sphere Source the sphere is centered on the center of the probe case to gain in isotropy
- Changed "entering PTER" condition: now is "from Not PTER to PTER" to consider also tracks from behind (before was "from frontshield")
- Added in output file name also info about the probe case

2018.06.14 by collamaf
- Substituted "Midle" with "Middle"
- Fix sphere source offset when no case is requested

- Added possibility to run in Multi Thread

2018.06.21 by collamaf
- Added scintillation for PTER (with ScintFlag from terminal, default NO). Actually addedd all Optical Physics but disabled for now Cerenkov directly in PhysList
- Added SiPm volume behind pter to score optical photons entering it
- Added scoring of "Npmt" in root file and "_Scint" to filename
- Now the progress status is printed on screen (since on Primaries file sometimes does not work) and every 10% of evts
- Changed condition to score primary decay product: added requeste StepN==0 to avoid double counting particles interacting via optical processes. Should not have any other undesired effect
- Excluded OptFot from InPter scoring to avoid huge size of root file
- Changed X and Z in filename to be in 0.1mm

2018.06.22 by collamaf
- Corrected error in FrontShield Thickness: was 5um is now 15

2018.06.27 by MorettiR
- Boolean Geometry Implemented for SiPM + TopCase solids

2018.07.06 by MorettiR
- Added G4ScoringManager in exampleB1.cc line 263 (Problem to be fixed).
- Addition of "GaSetting" flag to choiche experimental setup in Ga-Source Case.
- Addition of the 3D-Printed expreimental setup.
- In -GaSet 2  -CaseDepth>0 case, every distances are setted and can't be modified by line comand exept the ProbeCase Depth.
- In -GaSet 2 case exists only 2 configurations: if CaseDepth>0 we have the one with ProbeCase while if CaseDepth<0 we have the classic beta minus probe (that is an aluminum case behind the Pter).
- In -GaSet 2 case if CaseDepth<0 his absolute value correspondes to the aluminum case's length.
- In -GaSet 1 case we have the usual simulation (the one before this upgrade).
- To must be add, 3D-Printed expreimental setup's material.

2018.07.15 by MorettiR
- Added Absorber in -GaSet 2.
- Added flag PosAbsorber to choose absorber position in -GaSet2; if -PosAbs == 1 it will be placed in the hole just near the source, that has 2mm depth, while if -PosAbs == 2 it will be placed  in the hole that has 6mm depth.
- The Absorber thickness could be choosen by AbsT flag while the diameter is fixed in both PosAbsorber cases.
- The flag AbsD must be >=0.


2018.07.17 by MorettiR
- Added opportunity to select placement position of the absorber; the PosAbsorber now is used only to fix absorber diameter, in fact this depends in which hole I'll place the absorber.
- The -Z flag is used to choice the absorber's placement in -GaSet2 case.
- Example of a line comad for the optimal choice of the absorber type: ./exampleb1 -GaSet 2 -CaseDepth -40 -Source 4 -AbsD 0 -AbsT 1 -AbsMat 2 -AppMat 1 -Z 7 -PosAbs 2 ../run1.mac

2018.07.26 by MorettiR
- New leafs added in B1 and Source Branches 

2018.09.19 by MorettiR
- The position of the Probe in GaSet2 has been modified; now the top of the probe is placed at 5.5mm from the source (before at 8mm).
This because the configuration used at Gemelli's hospital in which the probe was placed on the absrober's surface (We used absorber of 5.5mm thickness). In the configuration without the absorber the probe was placed at the same distance of 5.5mm from the source.
- Fixed the position of the probe, now is take in consideration the dummy2's thickness.
- SourceDiameter now fixed at 10.*mm and SourceThickness at 7.*mm

2018.10.2 by collamaf

- Now the position of the probe's head ( the frontshield ) varies automatically with the placement of the absorber in GaSet 2.  
  N.B. in this way you have always to give AbsT and Z even if you do not want to place the absorber, for more details take a look to the flags section in this ReadMe file. 
- Name of the file with no abs in GaSet 2 has been modified. Now there is inside the name the distance of the probe from the source.


2018.11.14 by MorettiR
- A new leaf called "AnnihilationTime" has been added to B1 vector. This gives you the time elapsed since the positron's creation and his annihilation. 
- Now we can count the number of hits in the SiPM thanks to the new leaf "EabsSiPM" in B1 Vector.

2018.11.23 by MorettiR
- Added new configuration GaSet3; in this one the GaContainer is obtained by PVC and not printed by 3D printer. 
- File name modified to take into account GaSet3 configuration.
- New stepping action condition in source's branch (to be cheked). Take a look to line 144 an line 76 in stepping action to see changes. 

2018.12.03 by MorettiR
- Table added in GaSet1 configuration.

2018.12.05 by MorettiR
- Added new flag for absorber placement -ZAbs. This corresponds to the center of the absorber on z axes.
- Now in GaSet 2 and GaSet3, the flag -Z corresponds to the distance of the frontshield from the source on z axes (-Z must be always >= -AbsT when the absorber is placed to avoid superposition of volumes).
- Fixed superposistion of absorber in GaSet1
- Added study of Catafalco's material in GaSet3

2018.12.07 by MorettiR (morning)
- Fixed GaSet3 dimension of catafalco's Gacontainer.

2018.12.07 by MorettiR (afternoon)
- Fixed enumeration in B1RunAction (take a look also to B1EventAction).

2018.12.08 by MorettiR
- Fixed line 99 of B1RunAction.

2018.12.11 by MorettiR
- Fixed error in geometry relative to the source.
- Fixed error in PrimaryGeneratorAction relativo to GaSet 3.

2018.12.12 by MorettiR
- Fixed error in geometry relative to the dimension of the dummy2 in GaSet3.
- Fixed error in geometry relative to the dimension of the absorber in GaSet3.

2018.12.12 by MorettiR (afternoon)
- Now you can choose di thickness of the source in GaSet3.

2018.12.12 by collamaf
- Added flat sources (ele-6, gamma-7) for efficiency studies

2019.01.09 by collamaf
- First attempt of deep reorganization and cleaning of DetConst: seems to work fine at least up to GaSet 1. Please note that in this case the absorber is always ontop of source (no need of AbsorberPos) and the Z distance of the probe is always from source surface

2019.01.10 by collamaf
- Dummy reorganisation seems to work at least for Gaset 1 and 3. Need to fix DummyExitSource for GaSet 3, but first need to fix ExtGa z position in this case to start from the bottom of the hole

2019.01.14 by collamaf
- Finally got rid of all old "dummies". New 3 dummy scheme seems to work for all 3 gaset!
- Removed all references to FilePrim

2019.01.16 by collamaf
- Deep Cleaning of scoring, root file, PrimAction etc
- Now primary particle position in GaSet 2/3 is based on "Source" volume in DetConst
- Still need to clean OutFIleName creation in main

2019.01.17 by collamaf
- Cleaned OutFileName generation in main
- Fixed InPterPrimPart (was same as SourcePart)
- Updated readme about scoring

2019.04.01 by collamaf
- Updated readme about Efficiency (also for stanard pen like probe)

2019.10.02 by collamaf
- Added sourcechoice 8: Cu67 "ex-vivo" simple sample
- Added scoring of Vertex XYZ of particles exiting the source

2020.02.07 by collamaf
- Add extended F18 source (like Cu), source 9
- Fix StackAct condition to intercept decay product with new RadioactiveDecayBase process (should however be retro compatible)
- Now ScintFlag is passed to PhysList also (not only DetConst), since the mere process somehow overshadowed the RadioactiveDecay one preventing the StackAction scoring
- Add "AnaProbe" analysis macro
- Add ExitPart scoring also in B1 tree

2020.02.17 by collamaf
- Add new <0 SourceSelect, to choose generic radioactive ion: -SourceSelect -ZZAA (has the same source geometry than SourceSelect 8-9: simple active water voulme (manageble via SourceD SourceT) 

2020.02.25 by collamaf
- Fix physics list: opt4 and proper cuts (maybe excessive too..)

2020.10.08 by collamaf
- Add possibility to use external HepMC generator for 18F PET/CT simulations performed with GAMOS. SourceSelect=10, no source volume is built. Scoring of this kind of primary particle has to be fixed.

2020.10.16 by collamaf
- Add scoring of X Y Z position for PrePter

2020.12.23 by collamaf
- Add new source (11) for F18 container, to be used only around GaSet3. Seems to work and be retrocompatible with everything, but is a little too much accrocchiated. Probably time to perform a deep bottom-up reorganization of the whole simulation
- Restore MT capability and add automatic merging of root files

2021.01.19 by collamaf
- Go back to manual merging of root files in MT since the G4 way does not work on vectors

2021.01.19 by collamaf
- Add possibility to add a "SecondShield", i.e. 10um of scotch in front. Command line argument to activate it

2021.02.01 by collamaf
- Add absorber material 6 for black plastic, maybe PVC but with slightly higher density (1.4 vs 1.3))
- Fix missing water around GaContainer in 18F studies (source 11)

2021.02.08 by collamaf
- Massive cleaning of DetConst and README

2021.02.09 by collamaf
- Don't place dummyExitSorg with external file source

2021.02.09 by collamaf
- General cleaning of REAMDE
- Fix some wrong pos and sizes (dummy volumes..)
- Move to boolean solid for external layer of 18F (source 11)
- Add scoring of source particle region
- Add NUCLEOMED plastic material for absorbers

## TO DO's

- capire perche quando si accende la scintillazione poi guardando il verbose dell'evento al posto di RadioactiveDecay compare sempre "Scintillation" (ma lo scoring della sorgente lo risonosce uguale..)
